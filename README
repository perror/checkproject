Next in row: Coding style checking

Modules to write
----------------
* Coding style checking (pygments?)
  - Implements a module to check C syntax with proper
    coding style (my coding style).

* Build-system checking
  - run a build with 'make' and check result.
    (think about the timeout and fork-bomb)

* Black-box
  - run a command line with a timeout within a docker/qemu with
    limited amount of memory.

* Memcheck
  - Easy interface for valgrind (and easy results gathering)
