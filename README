* Scan the test in a directory hierarchy. (done)

Modules to write
----------------
* File checking
  - check presence of the required files
  - check the absence of unwanted files
    (executable files, back-up files, ...)
  - check the directory hierarchy of the project

* Coding style checking (pycparser?)
  - Implements a module to check C syntax with proper
    coding style (my coding style).

* Build-system checking
  - run a build with 'make' and check result.
    (think about the timeout and fork-bomb)

* Black-box
  - run a command line with a timeout within a docker with limited
    amount of memory.

* Memcheck
  - Easy interface for valgrind (and easy results gathering)

* Static-analysis
  - Easy way to integrate new static-analysis checks
    (clang-analyzer plugins ?)
